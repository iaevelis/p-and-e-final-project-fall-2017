# Aulos emulator
An arduino project that is able to emulate the play experience of a real life musical instrument (aulos)

## Summary

I built an arduino musical instrument that is capable of playing 7 keys.
Each individual keys are played through touching an assigned nail. when a specific key is touched, the speaker makes the designated voive

## Component Parts

- wood blocks: base.
- aluminium or iron nails: conductive parts
- arduino and other electronic parts (provided)

- inputs: fingers touch the conductive parts to indicate a keyboard press
- output: sound
- data: musical pitches and code

## Challenges

the most challanging part was to understand how does the code work and how to modify the parts I want to change(e.g. the pitches, number of keys, etc).
to change the pitches to the right ones was also challenging

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past five weeks?

- Week 1: Write proposal/start sear
- Week 2: looking for hardware
- Week 3: hardware completed, project detail changed
- Week 4: musical notes corrected
- Week 5: Present!
